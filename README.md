# Course Timetabling using Hill Climbing and MCTS

The project focused on applying Hill Climbing and Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithms to generate a schedule that adheres to both hard and soft constraints. The primary challenge was to strike a balance between generating a solution quickly and minimizing soft constraint costs. Additionally, identifying an effective heuristic was crucial for cost minimization.
